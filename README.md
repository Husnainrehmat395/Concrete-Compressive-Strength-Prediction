# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Prediction
In this project, I predicted concrete strength based on its mix and age using MATLAB. By analyzing data on cement, water, fly ash, slag, and age, I compared linear and nonlinear models to develop a tool that helps engineers design better concrete mixes, improving efficiency and safety in construction.
